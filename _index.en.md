Data Platform Documentation
Welcome to the documentation for the data platforms & Engineering . This document provides detailed information about the data platforms that we use to manage and process our data.

Overview of Data Platforms
Our data platforms are designed to help manage the entire data lifecycle, from storage and processing to analysis and visualization. We use the following platforms to manage our data:

Databricks: Databricks is a unified analytics platform that allows us to collaborate on big data and machine learning projects. With Databricks, we can easily access and manipulate data using a variety of programming languages and tools.

Prefect: Prefect is a workflow automation tool that we use to build, schedule, and monitor data pipelines. With Prefect, we can ensure that our data processing workflows run smoothly and efficiently.

Snowflake: Snowflake is a cloud-based data warehousing platform that allows us to store and analyze large amounts of data. With Snowflake, we can easily scale our data storage and processing capabilities as needed.

Getting Started
To get started using these platforms, refer to the individual sections of this document for more information. You'll find detailed instructions on how to set up, configure, and use each platform, as well as best practices and tips for getting the most out of your data.
